PasswordVault Website Overview:
PasswordVault is a secure web application developed using Python and Django, designed to help users safely store and manage their passwords in one centralized place. 
The main objective of this project is to reduce the need to remember multiple passwords by providing a secure, encrypted, and user-friendly platform. 
It allows users to register, log in, and store credentials such as website names, usernames, and passwords. 

Each password is encrypted before being saved in the database, ensuring privacy and protection against unauthorized access.

The website uses Django’s authentication system for secure login and account management, while the backend handles database storage and encryption using libraries like cryptography.
The frontend is designed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a clean, responsive interface, allowing users to easily add, update, or delete their stored credentials. 
JavaScript enhances interactivity by enabling features like password visibility toggling and copy-to-clipboard functions.

Through this project, developers gain hands-on experience in Django’s Model-Template-View (MTV) architecture, CRUD operations, and data security practices. 
It also demonstrates how to integrate encryption and authentication within a real-world web application.
Future enhancements could include two-factor authentication, password strength analysis, or cloud backup integration.
Overall, PasswordVault is a practical and secure web project that showcases the power of Python and Django in building modern, privacy-focused applications.
